    "## Topic 1: Assert Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Assert statements are like small little \"fact-checkers\" that you can insert into your code to make sure it is doing what you think it should do. For example, if a matrix should be 4x6 you can use an assert statement to check this; if the matrix is not the right size, and error will occur. Although your first thought may be \"why would I want to make my code break with an error?!?!\" it turns out this is a very useful debugging and testing tool (something we will cover in a later PA as well). The reason it is useful is that it causes your code to break for a _very specific_ reason, so that you can identify problems and fix them efficiently and confidently. Sounds useful, right?! Luckily assert statements are also quite simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two cases of this statement that we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "assert <logical_argument>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "assert <logical_argument>, 'my error message'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to illustrate the use of this tool is by example. But first, some important information about the `<logical_argument>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Information: Logical Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key aspect for using this tool effectively is to be aware of what a **logical statement** is and how they can be specified in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **logical statement** is simply a statement that can be evaluated as **true or false**. This is sometimes referred to as a **binary**, or, in computing in particular, a **Boolean**. Here are some examples of logical statements, formulated as questions, that have a binary/Boolean results:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of questions that cannot be evaluated as a logical statement:\n",

    "\n",
    "A _file path_ is like an address to a file. There are generally two types, _absolute_ and _relative._ Most of our activities focus on working in a  _working directory,_ so we will focus almost entirely on relative paths. The general format is like this:\n",

    "- forward slashes `/` separate subdirectories\n",
    "- the last two words are the file name and extension. For example, common image extensions are `.jpg`, `.png` or `.svg`\n",
    "- in this example, the image file is stored inside a folder called `subdir_2` which is inside a folder called `subdirectory_1` which is in our working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, **always use forward slashes whenever possible.** Although backward slashes are the default and must be used at times on Windows, they don't work on Mac or Linux systems. This causes problems when sharing code with others running these systems (or when we check your assignments on GitHub!!!). Remember that we try to do things in a way that allows easy collaboration: using approaches that are agnostic of the operating system (i.e., works on all platforms). This is hard to guarantee in practice, but consistently using forward slashes will get us close!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try it out yourself\n",
